# create a list of five numbers, starting from zero

numbers = [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]

# for num in range(5):
# 	numbers.append(num)

# create a tuple with the same information

numbers_tuple = (0, 1, 2, 3, 4)

# change the value fo the tuple in the last index

# CANNOT CHANGE A TUPLE
# because tuples are IMMUTABLE
# unlike lists, that can be changed as they are MUTABLE
